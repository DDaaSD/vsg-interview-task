          <h3 class="title-italic">When darkness overspreads my eyes</h3>
          <p class="underline-text">by JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE</p>
          <p>
            When, while the lovely valley teems with
            <span class="red-text"> vapour around me </span>, and the meridian
            sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my
            trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I
            throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream;
          </p>

          <p>
            and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are
            noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the
            stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of
            the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who
            formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love
            which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity
            of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes,
            and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power,
            like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with
            longing, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress
            upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it
            might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the
            infinite God!

          <h3 class="title-oblique">Give People Courage</h3>
          <p class="underline-text normal-big-text">The crowd seemed to grow</p>
          <p>
            The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened. The
            crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I
            heard now a faint murmur from it. The little knot of people towards
            Chobham dispersed. There was scarcely an intimation of movement from
            the pit.
          </p>

          <div class="img-wrapper">
            <img
              src="./img/hermiona-courage.jpeg"
              alt="Hermine hoping for courage"

            <p>Hermine hoping for courage.</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I
            suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore
            confidence. At any<span class="green-text"> rate, as the dusk </span
            >came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the sand pits began, a
            movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the evening
            about the cylinder remained unbroken. Vertical black figures in twos
            and threes would advance, stop, watch, and advance again, <span
              class="italic-text"
            >
              spreading out </span
            > as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to
            enclose the pit in its attenuated horns. I, too, on my side began to
            move towards the pit.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Lorem ipsum</li>
            <li>Dolor amet</li>
            <li>Slow motion</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand
            pits, and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels. I saw
            a lad trundling off the barrow of apples. And then, within thirty
            yards of the pit.

            be with you. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my

          <h3 class="title-normal">It wasn't a dream</h3>
          <p class="underline-text">by franz kafka</p>
          <p>
            One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found
            himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his
            armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see
            his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff
            sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready
            to slide off any moment.
          </p>

          <p>
            His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of
            him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?"
            he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room
            although a <a href="#">little too small</a>, lay peacefully between
            its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread
            out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it
            there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated
            magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted
            out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur
            muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.
            Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.
